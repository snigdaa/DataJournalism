          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>There seems to be a slight but not tight correlation Between
              poverty and the lack of healthcare; there seems to be a similar loose
              correlation between the poverty level and percent of people who smoke,
              but most states stay within a median range. Obesity across the states 
              doesn't seem to have much of a connection with poverty level, although
              some states with higher poverty levels also have a very high obesity level.
              This could have something to do with fast food/unhealthy food being more
              affordable than having to buy and make healthier food, or buy
            </p>
  
            <p>The median age for most states is common, between 30 and 40. There seems to
              be absolutely no correlation between median age and lack of healthcare, as the 
              states span randomly across the healthcare axis when compared to age. Similarly,
              most states stay within a common amount of smoking, between 15 and 25% for most states.
              And again with obesity, there seems to be no direct correlation between median age 
              and obesity levels. We can conclude that the median age of each state does not much
              affect the health risks of the state.
            </p>
  
            <p>There seems to be a general downward trend when comparing income and lack of 
              healthcare, which makes sense -- more wealthy states have better access to healthcare.
              There also seems to be an interesting and even stronger relationship between smoking and 
              income. Poorer states have much higher smoking percentages than wealthier states, which
              could have to do with the environmental influences of poorer states as well as the
              affordability of cigarettes vs. other drugs. Obesity in poorer states is also much
              more prevalent than in wealthier states, which could again be because, as we mentioned
              in the poverty analysis, healthier food, especially when compared to junk and fast food,
              can be much more expensive to buy or make, and people with lower incomes may not be able 
              to afford it.
